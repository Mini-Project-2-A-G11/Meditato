        <h3>What Does “Mind Body and Spirit” Truly Mean?</h3>
        <img src="/MEDIA/images/blog01.png" alt="image" />

          <p>
            You have heard people talk about the connection between the mind,
            body, and spirit. Many people have a hazy interpretation of what it
            means, but it simply pertains to an individual’s mental, physical,
            and emotional/spiritual health. You have likely noticed that when
            something is troubling you mentally or emotionally, you actually
            begin to manifest symptoms physically. Your heart starts racing, you
            may sweat more than usual, you have a hard time sleeping because you
            keep thinking about the problem – and you begin to feel lethargic
            and fatigued. This is when the mind-body-spirit are out of balance.
            However, when your mind is at peace, you are more likely to be
            happier, kinder, and more grateful, because you’re not so embroiled
            from within. Physically, you are relaxed and ready to take on
            whatever life throws your way.

            The Connection Between Mind, Body, and Spirit
          </h3>
          <p>
            Dealing with struggles is a part of life that cannot always be
            avoided. Strengthening the connection between the mind, body, and
            spirit takes effort, so here is how these three factors work
            together to benefit your overall health:
          </p>
          <h3 class="inner-headings">A Healthy Mind</h3>
          <p>
            Someone with a healthy mind keeps the brain exercised regularly, and
            stress and worry are kept at bay by choice. Positive thoughts,
            gratitude, and a feeling of joy are present, and there is a thirst
            for knowledge and learning. Just like the brain requires sleep every
            night, the brain also requires things to think about and to ponder.
          </p>
          <h3 class="inner-headings">A Healthy Body</h3>
          <p>
            A healthy body is free of disease and illness, and it is not riddled
            with pain. Bodily health is also made possible by a healthy diet,
            good nutrition, and regular exercise. A healthy body naturally wants
            to move and seeks activity. Maintaining physical health also
            includes keeping regular checkups with your primary care doctor in
            order to prevent illness, or to detect it and treat it right away if
            a disease does exist.
          </p>
          <h3 class="inner-headings">A Healthy Spirit</h3>
          <p>
            Being spiritual is being centered and having an understanding that
            you are part of something much bigger than yourself. Facilitating a
            healthy spirit includes being part of a community to share yourself
            with others, and to give without expecting anything tangible in
            return. A healthy spirit requires love.
