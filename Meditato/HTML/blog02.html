        <h3>Emotions Are Energy : The bodymind connection and e-motion</h3>

          <h3 class="inner-headings">What are emotions?</h3>
          <p>
            Let’s start by exploring a basic understanding of emotions that will
            likely be dramatically different than what you have believed up to
            this point. What we think of as emotion is the experience of energy
            moving through the body. This is generally felt as sensations of
            contraction such as tension or expansion such as calm. The Latin
            derivative for the word emotion, ‘emotere’, literally means energy
            in motion. Researcher Barbara Frederickson furthered this
            understanding by describing the upward and downward spiral effect of
            emotion. An upward spiral correlates with expansion and feelings
            such as joy and happiness. A downward spiral correlates with
            contraction and feelings such as resentment and fear.

          <h3 class="inner-headings">Emotional Energy</h3>
          <p>
            As a result of these findings, the emotional brain is considered to
            have executive power in the brain. It influences all decision
            making, thought processes, memories, and present experiences. Your
            ability to understand, deal with, and effectively use your emotional
            energy is vital to your happiness levels. The sensations you feel in
            your body hold the key to unlocking limiting patterns, transforming
            stress, and generating lasting happiness. Your body gives a constant
            stream of reliable information about your experience in the form of
            sensation. It’s a library of who you are at the deepest level,
            including all that has happened to you and all that you dream about.
            Understanding your body sensations will transform your life.6 For
            many people, looking to their body sensations to transform
            challenging emotions and increase emotional intelligence is the most
            important piece of the puzzle that leads to happiness. This is
            especially true when you understand that sensory and emotional
            information is recorded into memory first; thoughts and perceptions,
            second. This distinction provides clues for increasing emotional
            intelligence while pointing out the limitations of purely
            thought-based approaches.

          <h3 class="inner-headings">Driven to Move E-Motion</h3>
          <p>
            The drive to move your emotional energy is present every moment
            because your nervous system is in constant pursuit of homeostasis.
            It’s on a mission 24/7 regulating the balance of your bodymind
            connection. This often includes your instinctual drive to be happy
            by releasing any pent-up stress. You have an opportunity to move
            your emotional energy each time you experience contraction, tension,
            or any other body sensations. They are the internal messages of your
            bodymind wisdom that draw you toward balance and happiness. Given
            the understanding that emotion is actually energy in motion it is
            important to distinguish what it looks and feels like to increase
            your emotional awareness. Most people believe this looks like using
            their thinking mind to analyze, think about and talk about how they
            feel. Although this approach can bring initial awareness it is not
            effective in the long run. It is common from this approach to hinder
            the process of expressing and managing emotions. In doing so, it
            keeps the process of expression at the level of thought vs. actual
            feeling or energy movement. In order to successfully express emotion
            you have to move your emotional energy by identifying the sensations
            and releasing states of contraction.
