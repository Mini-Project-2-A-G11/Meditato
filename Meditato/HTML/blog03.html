        <h3>The Ego Mind Vs the True Self</h3>
        <img src="/MEDIA/images/blog03.png" alt="image" />
        <div class="paras">
          <p>
            Most of us live in a bipolar state and I don’t mean bipolar
            disorder. We live between two polarities – the Ego Mind and the True
            Self. You may have heard me say before, that the human race is
            experiencing an evolution. The more we embrace this evolution by
            being willing to grow and become present, the more we will be living
            as our True Self. Nothing happens overnight however, unless we are
            lucky enough to be struck by the wand of enlightenment in our sleep
            – and it does happen for some, such as Eckhart Tolle (after much
            suffering may I add). However most of us will be dipping in and out
            of our True Self. Sometimes our Ego Mind will dominate and sometimes
            our True Self will be in charge, and that’s OK and normal. This is
            where awareness is very valuable.

          <h3 class="inner-headings">
            What is the difference between the ego mind and the True Self?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Our ego mind is our false self – the conditioned self – who is not
            in touch with who we really are. It feeds on the vibration of fear
            and lives through a paradigm of Win/Lose (I win and therefore you
            must lose – also known as competition). When we are in ego we will
            feel contracted and small and “all alone”, and so we seek POWER. Ego
            power can feel good and it’s very addictive. Think of times when
            someone has hurt you and you seek to “get your own back”. It can
            feel wonderful at the time, but the good effect is short-lived, and
            often regretted. The ego mind can also be needy. It does not want to
            lose anything and so it clings to people, places and situations.
            When we are in our ego mind, we will be dominated by the emotions of
            envy, jealousy, guilt, anger, resentment and other toxic emotions as
            well as loneliness. We can also experience feel-good emotions –
            excitement, elation and ecstasy, but these never last. When they go,
            we drop down to the same disconnected, lonely feeling that existed
            before, which can feel devastating. So the ego mind will have us
            experiencing an emotional rollercoaster of ups and downs. The ego
            doesn’t like to feel bad and so it looks for quick-fixes and is the
            basis of all addictions. The ego worries about what other people
            think of us and acts from an outside point of view as opposed to
            being self-directed, and just as it fears judgment; it also judges
            others, creating separation, loneliness and isolation.

          <h3 class="inner-headings">What is true happiness?</h3>
          <p>
            There are a lot of books out there on happiness. True happiness is
            the state of inner peace and serenity. Some of us don’t recognise
            that this is happiness – so conditioned are we that we think
            happiness is excitement, elation and ecstasy – but these emotions
            are always short-lived. As human beings, we do not have the energy
            to sustain such a state of being for that long. What comes up must
            come down. The more we seek thrills, the more depression and despair
            we also experience. Our lives will certainly include moments of peak
            experiences, but the more in touch with our True Self we are, the
            more we do not identify with the thrill. We can enjoy it for what it
            is, but not cling to it, or hope that it will last, or take it too
            seriously, knowing that “this too shall pass”.
          </p>
          <h3 class="inner-headings">
            How can we begin to connect more with our True Self?
          </h3>
          <p>
            We can only start this journey to the True Self from where we are
            today. There are no shortcuts. We need to fully embrace who we are
            right now – we don’t get anywhere by denying our ego. The only way
            to transcend the ego mind is by: Bringing AWARENESS to it Realising
            there is a SPACE between the ego mind’s desire and our action
            Choosing to transcend the ego’s desires with the vibration of LOVE.
            <br />
            Asking the question “What would love do now?” is a powerful
            question. <br />
            Here are further ways of becoming present and getting more in touch
            with your True Self : Practise presence and observation – Whenever
            you can, become aware of the present moment – right here, right now
            – and simply observe it. Simply observe without thought. Set an
            alarm on your phone two or three times a day, or put a few signs
            around your home or work space with the word PRESENCE or NOW to
            remind you to make contact with the present moment right now.
            <br />
            1. Meditate – Sitting with yourself and observing your thoughts,
            emotions, agitations and distractions is a highly effective way to
            become self-aware. Pay attention to your breath – This is a great
            way to become more present. Again, if you’re new to this, set an
            alarm on your phone two or three times daily to practise.
            <br />
            2. Feel your body – The body is not the busy ego-mind. Feeling the
            inside of our body brings awareness. The body is constantly talking
            to you, telling you the truth. When you connect in with your body,
            you disconnect from your busy ego-mind. Observe nature – Simply by
            sitting and observing nature, you are connecting in with the
            Universal Source.
            <br />
            3. Yoga/exercise – Undertake exercise in a self-observant way.
            Notice your breath, feel your bodily sensations, observe your
            thoughts. Stay present.
            <br />
            4. Do something you love or do something creative – When you are
            fully engaged in a create activity that you enjoy, you can feel
            totally present and connected, and the ego mind falls away. Paint,
            write, build, decorate, sew, knit, garden, colour-in, play –
            whatever gives you joy creatively, make some time to do it.
