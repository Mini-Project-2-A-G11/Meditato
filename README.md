## Course Abstract
Computer Engineering is a field that integrates hardware and software design. The branch focuses on not only the study of the working of computer systems, but also brings light to the role they play in the big picture. This can be seen in its various applications, from the design of microprocessors to software development. In the 21st century, the Computer Engineering industry is one of the forefronts for technological innovation.

Mini Project 2-A emphasizes on innovation and entrepreneurship through software development. It involves questioning different areas of the field of study - What innovations can we introduce? How can we improve existing models? We are motivated to identify our own methodologies and practice project management principles such as researching different domains, validation and verification of data, and documenting the project through technical report writing. With this in mind, we proceed with project-based learning.

## Project Introduction
The 21st century has witnessed the peak of human evolution. Never before have we set forth to our everyday lives knowing that an abundance of knowledge lies at our fingertips. We've come a long way from the time of analog and manual procedures, ways that go far beyond the impact of the industrial revolution. Automation has driven not only the manufacturing process, but global economies towards the farthest reaches of technological innovation.

Speaking for the past decade, we are also witnessing a call for innovating not just technology - but ourselves as humans. We have taken to becoming more aware of ourselves and our abilities. The timing couldn't be better, since smart technologies have also proven to be terrible distractions to the same extent as they prove catalysts to our productivity. 

In the midst of this exploration as to what we can do to better ourselves, a set of practices come to picture. These practices focus on enhancing our physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Among them, mindful practices such as meditation and yoga are the most popular.

Meditation is scientifically proven to enhance a person's well-being. That being said, it remains a practice practiced by surprisingly few. This is due to inefficient management when it comes to practicing the habit itself. People fail to follow a systematic approach towards meditation. The problem thus presents itself as the lack of a management system for the habit of meditation. There exists a need for a management tool to assist an aspiring practitioner.
The tool we propose is a meditation management system. It allows the user to not only browse through meditation courses, but also engage with the system. The system will encourage the user along the way with personalized motivational messages and a pleasing user interface.
